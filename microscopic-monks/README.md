Primal is an uncompromising "roguelike" wilderness survival game. Explore the world, find new technologies, and most importantly, survive. As the game continues, everything becomes evermore difficult and your life will become harder. 

## Instructions

When you load into Primal, the clock starts ticking, your health will start depleting, your food running out. You must survive! If you find berry bushes, you can find berries that will regenerate your health, but be fast, and gather as many as possible! There are also rocks and bushes that you must break. Chances are, a fellow person may have left a weapon there!

Good luck fellow human!
