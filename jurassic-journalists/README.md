For the theme of "Ancient Technology", we decided to go with a typewriter, an antiquated piece of technology said to have been used by the Sumerians to record trading logs.

Originally meant to be a modern word processor without the ability to delete, it has transformed into an immersive experience with the ability to type over former words and scribble Wite-Out on the paper to erase mistakes. 

How to use:
-Press the keys on the digital keyboard to type. Press backspace to back up, and type over words.
-Scribble on the paper with the cursor to use Wite-Out.
-To make a new line, press the lever on the left.
-To change text color, click the color wheel.
