# Next-Door Nuns

This is a cannon game, in which you can adjust the cannon's velocity and angle parameters to fire a cannon ball at the
Python Discord logo target.  After running the application, you can follow these steps:
1) Enter a velocity (Greater than 0)
2) Click Submit
3) Enter Angle (from 0-90 degrees)
4) Click Submit
5) Click fire!

The cannonball will then fire, and if the target is hit, an indication will pop up and another target will be
randomly generated. 

To change the velocity or angle, just enter a new value in the window and click submit. Then click fire again to fire the cannonball at the target.
