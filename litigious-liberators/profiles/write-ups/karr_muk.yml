Biography: >
  You've obviously already heard of me, but anyway: I'm Karr, the famous pop-star! Dinosaurs from
  nearby clans are really crazy for me, but I thought I'd try this new app thing out. I'm strictly
  non-vegetarian, so mind that - hey, don't blame me, vegans - it's not my fault T-Rexs are
  carnivores...
