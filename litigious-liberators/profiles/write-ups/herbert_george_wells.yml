biography: >
  I'm a writer. One of my most popular novels is The Time Machine, which a scientist read and got
  inspired enough to make an actual one. Being a good scientist, the first person he visited using
  it was me, and after using it to his heart's content he let me have it. So, here I am, in your
  time period!
