Biography: >
  I love flying and terrorizing the enemy clans now and then, just in case they were thinking
  we'd gone passive and it was fine for them to attack. I'm very devoted to my clan, and
  participate in most territory-expansion campaigns, and am considered a very valuable member
  of our Air Force.
Interests: ['flying', 'painting', 'skiing']
