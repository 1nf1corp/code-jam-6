## What is it
Our project is broken down into two core parts, an engine and game creator to allow you to make your very own games and

### Jurassic Greg
You are Greg. You were minding your own business rubbing two sticks together, and poof! you discovered fire. Whilst you 
didn't ask for this kind of evolution, you've got to live with it now, and with all the choices that come alongside being a robust modern man. 
For example, T-Rexes, should you kick them?


Throughout the game you'll be presented with a range of cards, you don't have to micromanage every little decision of 
life - just some of the little decisions. Whether to take a bath in the river, make a pterodactyl omelette, or whether 
maybe you *should* have kicked that T-Rex, you'll be responsible for ensuring the continuation of the great line of Greg.

Each choice you make will have two options, you need to decide whats best for Greg.

### Card RPG engine
## Using it
### Playing the game
Playing the game is just about as simple as it  gets. You run the app, and you're presented with a choice. You make a choice,
rinse and repeat.

### Making your own game

## The Team
### Braindead
BrainDead was the MVP of the project, implementing practically the entire backend of the system, both the editor and the engine. 
Taking general ideas from the whole team, providing plenty of his own, and turning them all into reality.
### Charlie
Charlie focused on getting the Kivy layout working. Finding assets, shifting things around by 5 pixels at a time. 
Coming up with the overall look and feel for Jurassic Greg, as well as the customisable design.
### GlowingRunes
In addition to wireframing the layout, defining the style, and designing the first UI, GlowingRunes provided some 
fantastic audio assets for the project, carrying the unique look and feel throughout the game.
### Heagan
Heagan was a key player in the idea and design phase, providing insight and research into the design and implementation 
of the eventual game, as well as implementing Animations for the front end of the app.
