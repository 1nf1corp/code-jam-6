Hello and thanks for using Rex-Explorer! Made over the course of a week for CodeJam VI, Rex-Explorer is a TUI file explorer with a built in terminal and many other features!

Features
- Be able to experience what it was like to browse files and directories on your computer from the old days!

- A built in terminal? Yeah we were suprised too! Be able to change directories and even commit your own project to github!

- A built in editor too! What, did you just want to look at your files. See what it was like to edit files back in the old'n days!

- A built in photo viewer!? We added this in at the absolute last minute, and it's a great addition to the program.

- Create files and directories to utilize with the built in editor, terminal and file explorer.

- Rename and Copy files and directories across your browser.
