Welcome to the sixth Python Discord Code Jam!

By popular choice, the theme for this code jam is **Ancient Technology**. What you do with this theme or how you interpret it is up to you, but we're sure you can come up with something fun. As the technlogy for this code jam, we've chosen for [Kivy](https://kivy.org/), a cross-platform framework for making user interfaces. We know that a lot of you are probably relatively new to this framework and that's why some of Kivy's [core developers](https://kivy.org/#aboutus) will be hanging out in the #winter-code-jam channel!

## Getting Started

1. Have your team leader fork the repository. If your leader is unavailable, it's okay if someone else does it.

2. Open a pull request from your fork's `master` to the `master` branch of this repository. This pull requests will eventually count as your team's submission, but make sure **to open the PR as the code jam starts**.

3. Make sure to **only make changes within your team's subdirectory**. The repository should already contain a directory with your team's name as the name.

4. Since you are making a pull request from the `master` of your fork, it would probably be best to use different branches in your repository to work on your project. You can then periodically merge those development branches into the `master` branch.

    For an ideal developer workflow, you should probably be opening pull requests inside of your fork, targeting your own `master` branch. If this doesn't make any sense to you because you're not that well-versed in git, you will probably be okay with all of you just pushing code directly to your master branch, but keep in mind that this may lead to conflicts if you are all working in parallel.

5. The Pull Request will be automatically updated whenever you push code to master on your fork, so all you have to do is keep pushing code to it and make sure you are finished before the code jam ends!
