## Ancient Technology!
The world today is too busy. So many digits and dials everywhere! Things were much simpler in the past; the sun, moon, seasons and tides. Donâ€™t you wish you could go back and live the neolithic life?

Wish no longer! The Ancient Clock brings all the simplicity of rock based neolithic time keeping to your modern crushed, ground, reconstituted, laser etched rock based rock!

Keep track of important times such as:
* When sun comes up
* When sun goes down
* When sun is inbetween those two things

### Functionality
The main dial in the app represents 24 hours and the major events you're likely to care about as a neolithic human. 

Your location can either be specified in settings or gathered by IP geolocation.
